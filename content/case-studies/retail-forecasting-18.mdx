We delivered a production forecast in twelve weeks by focusing on a narrow SKU set,
clean interfaces, and observable pipelines.

## Approach

- Thin feature store with versioned inputs
- Automated evaluation with sMAPE and service KPIs
- Blue/green deploy and simple owner runbook

## Outcome

- +18% sMAPE improvement on priority SKUs
- Hours-to-minutes training cycles
- Shared view of accuracy and operations impact
