Achieving a true Customer 360 required reconciling identities across sources and driving action
via high-quality audiences and journeys.

## Highlights

- Deterministic + probabilistic ID resolution
- Reverse ETL to ad and messaging platforms
- Uplift experimentation with causal ML

```python title="features/churn.py"
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier

model = GradientBoostingClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
proba = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]
```

## Outcomes

- 15% reduction in churn rate
- +9% incremental revenue from improved retention
- Faster audience build cycles (hours, not weeks)
